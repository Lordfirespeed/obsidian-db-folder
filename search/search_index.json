Creating Notes with a Template You have to choose a template in the bottom bar before creating the note. You can filter the files suggested in the bottom bar by adding a folder in the settings under rows template file folder location . It works with the core template plugin. But with the templater plugin, you have to activate the option Trigger templater on new file creation in templater settings. Deleting & Renaming Notes You can click on the numbers to the right of every row, to bring up a menu where you can delete and rename the note associated with the row. Moving Notes Based on Metadata The database will watch for changes in the select property column and create folders for each option present. The notes will be placed under the corresponding folder based on the option chosen. You can choose one or many select properties by which this rule will run. If you choose more than one, the folders will be nested and the nesting order will follow the order by which the select properties are added in the database settings. For example \"select1/select2/select3\" . This setting can be found under configuration about columns > Columns to group by . You have additional settings to customize this rule under configuration about columns in the database settings : By default, the folder is not created until you choose the corresponding select option. You can enable automatic folder creation which will not wait for changes and create the folders directly after setting the rule. You can enable folder deletion if a folder is empty. Because, by default, if the select option is not chosen by any notes, in other words, the associated folder is empty, it is not deleted. Don't worry though, the folder will be created again if the appropriate select option is chosen. When you're grouping by more than one select property. Let's say you have one note that has 2 select properties select1/select2 with select1 = something and select2 = (nothing) . By default, because this note is missing one select property, it will be stored at the root of the folder used for storing the database notes.

They allow you to model complex relationships between your data. For example, a User can have many Post s, and a Post can have many Comment s. This is a one-to-many relationship. You can also have many-to-many relationships, where a User can have many Post s, and a Post can have many User s. How to use To create a relation, you need to create a column with the Relation type. You can then select the table you want to relate to. You can also select the column you want to use as the relation key as Rollup . This is the column that will be used to match the rows. For example, if you have a User table with a Name column, and a Post table with an Author column, you can use the Name column as the relation key. Rollups Once you create a relation, you can use the rollup function to get the related rows. For example, if you have a User table with a Name column, and a Post table with an Author column, you can use the rollup function to get all the posts for a given user.

Sticky First Column You can make the first column sticky in the database settings to make it always visible even when scrolling horizontally. Pagination To help with displaying a lot of data, by default the database displays only 10 rows and allows changing the pages using the top bar. You can change the number of rows displayed per page in the database settings. Row Height In the database settings under cell size , you can change the row height between 3 options (compact, normal, wide). Filtering Using the database top bar, you can create one or multiple filters or you can search (normally or with regex) for any metadata displayed in the database. You can either create a filter or a group filter . The difference is that a group filter can include many filters with either an AND or an OR type of relationship, whereas filters can only have an AND type of relationship between them. You can create a group filter within a group filter for more granular filtering, and you can delete or rename them. Keep in mind that deleting a parent group filter will delete all the children group filters within it. Each group filter will have a dedicated named button on the database top bar to quickly enable/disable it. It's important to note that the state of all the filters is determined by another button. So in this case, you have to enable both the named button and the filter button for group filters to work. The database filters hold priority over the dataview query source filters. Refresh Database There is no actual refresh button, but you can use the activate/desactive filter button to refresh the database. Sorting You can sort one column or multiple columns from the column's menu in descending or ascending order. The sort priority is displayed as a number next the arrow in the column header. To remove the sort, just use the column menu. Database Markdown You can view the database markdown note by using the command open as markdown in obsidian menu or in the database menu. To re-enable the database view, just close the pane and re-open it again. Embedding Database You can embed a database in another note by using this format ![[database file name.md]] , it'll show a dataview query of the database. Exporting Data You can export the database into CSV format using the database menu. Importing Data You can upload a CSV file and turn it into a database using the database menu.
